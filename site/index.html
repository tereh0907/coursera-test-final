Before some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) h in an unstressed first syllable, such as hallucination, hilarious, historic(al), horrendous, and horrific, some (especially older) British writers prefer to use an over a (an historical event, etc.).[7] An is also preferred before hotel by some writers of British English (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, in which the h is not pronounced).[8] The use of "an" before words beginning with an unstressed "h" is more common generally in British English than in American.[8] American writers normally use a in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of an historic(al) in American English.[9] According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in British English too.[7] Unlike British English, American English typically uses an before herb, since the h in this word is silent for most Americans. The correct usage in respect of the term "hereditary peer" was the subject of an amendment debated in the UK Parliament.[10]

Using a before a word beginning with a vowel sound in unstressed syllables - such as I left a orange on the working surface. - is not uncommon, but is universally considered non-standard.

The word some is used as a functional plural of a/an.[citation needed] "An apple" never means more than one apple. "Give me some apples" indicates more than one is desired but without specifying a quantity. This finds comparison in Spanish, where the singular indefinite article "un/una" ("one") is completely indistinguishable from the unit number, except where it has a plural form ("unos/unas"): Dame una manzana" ("Give me an apple") > "Dame unas manzanas" ("Give me some apples"). However, some also serves as a quantifier rather than as a plural article, as in "There are some apples there, but not many."

Some also serves as a singular indefinite article, as in "There is some person on the porch".</p>
